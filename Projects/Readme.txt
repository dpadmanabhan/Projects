Code folder contains summer project scripts and ML models:
Given the historical monitoring data of the nodes, machine learning models will be trained to
understand the past behavior and would be used for future predictions.
● Generated workload to simulate the real time traffic generated by applications in a cluster
environment and collected about 50k datapoints across 10 cluster nodes.
● Built models to predict the I/O attributes like Availability, load percentage and Remaining
capacity of the disks.
